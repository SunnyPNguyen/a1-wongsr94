#### Q1: What are the “Combined” fields referring to? How do you think this information may affect our analyses?

Q1 The public datasets must meet the standards for aggregating and anonymizing customer data pursuant to CPUC Decision 14-05-016, as follows:  a minimum of 100 Residential customers; a minimum of 15 Non-Residential customers, with no single Non-Residential customer in each sector accounting for more than 15% of the total consumption.  If the aggregation standard is not met, the consumption will be combined with a neighboring ZIP code until the aggregation requirements are met. This will mean that the zip code might not correspond exactly to its actual customers. The data will be from a wider area.



#### Q2: Why are the “Average” fields likely not useful for our analyses?

Q2 Due to the customer composition of each postal code and the definite difference in usage between different types of customers, the 'Average' field will not give a good indicator. 



#### Q3: What type of calculations should "X" and "Y" be in the step above? Why?
